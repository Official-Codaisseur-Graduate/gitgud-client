# About branches

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

# You can use branches to:

#### Develop features

#### Fix bugs

#### Safely experiment with new ideas
